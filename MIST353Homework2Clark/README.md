# MIST 353 Assignment 2

## Project Overview
My project is a weather application that will help a person try to predict the best Manchester City soccer match to go to
based on weather data. This application allows the user to see the record of Manchester City based certain weather conditions, 
their opponent, and location of where the club will be playing. 
This application also goes over all of the leagues and competions that the club competes in because the club plays all around the world in different climates.
My application is currently in the very early stages of development. It has all of the required elements on the page that are needed, but needs 
formatting in future revisions.

## Page Descriptions
In my application I have two pages in this stage of development, the home page and premier league page. The concept of the home page is to 
give the user an introduction to the applicaiton. It gives a brief description on what the app is and what it does. The technical side of the homepage is that it 
acts like a hub for each competition that Manchester City competes in. When a user clicks on a competition, the home page will direct them to that specific webpage 
for each competition. As of now the only page that works in this stage is the premier league link. The second page in my application is the premier league 
page (SearchResultsPL).This page will give the record of Manchester City that matches a certain weather condition when playing opponents 
in the Premier League. The technical aspect of the website is that it calculates the record of Manchester City. It takes in opponents, location, and temperature 
as conditions, from the user, to generate the specific record. It does so by using dropdown boxes to fill in conditions and uses a search button to 
obtain the record. The page also has an added funciton that will dispaly what type of jersey is best to wear in the weather that the 
team is playing in.

## Research Summary
In my research of finding three similar websites and two relevant GitHub Repositories, I found very useful information.
