# MIST 353 Assignment 2

## Project Overview
My project is a weather application that will help a person try to predict the best Manchester City soccer match to go to
based on weather data. This application allows the user to see the record of Manchester City based on certain weather conditions, 
their opponent, and the location of where the club will be playing. This application also goes over all of the leagues and competitions
that the club competes in because the club plays all around the world in different climates. My application is currently in the 
very early stages of development. It has all of the required elements on the page that are needed but needs formatting in future revisions.

## Page Descriptions
In my application I have two pages in this stage of development, the home page and the premier league page. The concept of the home page is to 
give the user an introduction to the application. It gives a brief description of what the app is and what it does. The technical side of the homepage is that it 
acts like a hub for each competition that Manchester City competes in. When a user clicks on a competition, the home page will direct them to that specific webpage 
for each competition. As of now the only page that works in this stage is the premier league link. The second page in my application is the premier league 
page (SearchResultsPL). This page will give the record of Manchester City that matches a certain weather condition when playing opponents in the Premier League. 
The technical aspect of the website is that it calculates the record of Manchester City. It takes in opponents, location, and temperature as conditions, from the user, 
to generate the specific record. It does so by using dropdown boxes to fill in conditions and using a search button to obtain the record. The page also has an added 
function that will display what type of jersey is best to wear in the weather that the team is playing in.

## Research Summary
In my research of finding three similar websites, I found very useful information. My three websites were a soccer almanac, a Manchester City database, and a soccer 
stadium weather app. These websites all had similar designs to mine in the formatting aspect. Each had the same structure and functions with URL changes. While looking at 
the browser inspect tool, I could see what that similar format and structure looks like. This information gave me a general idea of how to structure my very own web application.
The soccer stadium weather app was the most useful site that I found in my research. This website had the same innovative ideas that I wanted to emulate in my own web application. 
Overall, each sight provided very useful ideas and information to help kickstart my very own web application.

Like websites, relevant GitHub repositories were also a very helpful tool to research and analyze. The first repository that I found useful to me was a sports page website. This 
repository provided code for a website developed for a cricket team. This page had very similar ideas that I was going to use for my very own application. The second repository 
that I found useful was code on a weather website. This website would tell you the weather of any city. I found this repository to be very useful since weather data is the main focus 
of my own web application. Each repository had different READMEs. The weather app's README was just showing what the code looked like when run, while the sports page README provided 
the description and function of the web application. They were both useful to me because of the similar ideas that I will implement in my own web application.

## Future Enhancements
When looking at my web application in its prototype state, it could use some improvements. Some of the following improvements I would include would be:

- Improved formatting
- More pages
- Improved functionality

These changes are all front-end related and would greatly improve the interactivity of the whole application. With my current application in it's prototype stage, 
I believe these further enhancements would drastically improve my web application. I am not worried about back-end considerations quite yet because of the stage 
of development, my web application is in as of now.

## Reflection on Resources
Each source that I used had its own unique utility. For my main web application coding, I mainly used the class lectures and W3Schools to help me do a big chunk of the work. 
If I needed help with something specific that I could not find on W3Schools I would refer to ChatGPT to help with a code snippet. The main challenges of my resources were organization 
and navigation. The abundance of resources made challenges for me because I would try to look over each source to find one thing when I could have just sat down and most likely 
could have found it in one source. After using all the sources, I would say I prefer the lecture recordings and W3Schools over any of the other resources. I found these to be the 
most helpful to me and for my web application.
